Summary: How to add a new Sequencing Price to the Bauer Core MiniLIMS system

[TOC]

## Create a new Sequencing Price record

[Log in](https://bauer-minilims.rc.fas.harvard.edu/minilims "Log in") as an admin into minilims.

Go to the 'Add Page->HarvardSCLims->Sequencing Price' menu entry to bring up a price form.

Fill out the form with the relevant fields and prices.  If the status is set to inactive then it won't be used for any billing or cost estimations.

The Display_Name field has to be in a certain format for everything to be billed correctly.  We have to match the run type selected in the submission form to this field in each price.

## Construct the Display_Name Field

For new prices the format of the Display_Name should be

    <run_type> <readcount> x <readlen> bp

* `<run_type>` is the sample run type in the [submission form](https://bauer-minilims.rc.fas.harvard.edu/minilims//plugins/Core/submit_batch.php?parenttype=Submission&childtype=Sample&name=new "submission form") (see screenshot below)

	</a>
    <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

* readcount is 1 for unpaired or 2 for paired - read length should be a number e.g.

    Megaseq (v2) 2 x 100 bp

Megaseq (v2) is the run type selected in the submission form 2 means a paired end run 100 is the read length. Please make sure there is only one space between the elements. The different run_types are found in the submission form (and can be configured from the Configure Page->Sample configuration screen)

## Existing Display_Name Fields are slightly different

For historical reasons some of the sequencing prices are treated differently as the format is a little different. These are listed below:

### NextSeq Runs

    Submission run type      Price Display_Name

    NextSeq_High             "NextSeq <1|2> x <readlen> bp - High"
    NextSeq_Mid              "NextSeq <1|2> x <readlen> bp - Mid"

### Rapid Runs

    Submission run type     Price Display_Name

    Rapid_single_lane       “Rapid Run <1|2> x <readlen> bp - Single Lane"
    Rapid_full_flow_cell    “Rapid Run <1|2> x <readlen> bp - Full Flowcell"

### Standard Runs

    Submission run type    Price Display_Name
    Standard_v4            “Standard Run (v4) <1|2> x <readlen> bp"
    Standard_v3            “Standard Run <1|2> x <readlen> bp"
