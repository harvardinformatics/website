<p>
Learn the practical use of Python on the FAS Odyssey cluster by working through common challenges of the Python language and Odyssey environment. Topics will include file I/O, shell execution, Slurm job submission, package installation, virtual environments, and parallel execution.
</p>
<p>
While some basic Python constructs will be covered, the course will be difficult to follow without at least tutorial-level understanding of the language (e.g. https://www.learnpython.org/). An Odyssey cluster account, basic Linux knowledge, and Linux editor skills (vi, nano, etc.) are required.
</p>
<p>
We will break for an hour 12-1pm.
