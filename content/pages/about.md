## Our Mission
The Informatics and Scientific Applications group is a small group working in the cramped space between faculty, core facilities and high performance computing. We have a number of core responsibilities including first pass analysis for the sequencing core and software/analysis support for the proteomics mass-spectrometry core.     We also support the infrastructure for instrument scheduling and invoicing across many FAS facilities.

A large part of our remit is to smooth the path of scientific discovery by working with faculty, post-docs and grad students to design and analyze sequencing experiments for the most efficient bang for the buck.  Our group is currently small (two bioinformaticians and two web developers) so we have limited resources to fulfill this area but we are aiming to grow and expand our services.

## Services

The Informatics group provides bioinformatics analysis support for all users of the Core Sequencing facility and to FAS faculty groups regardless of the origin of their data.    In addition we have the responsibility for sample submission, tracking, scheduling and billing services for many of the core instrument facilities across FAS.

We are small in number and try to cover the needs of as many people across campus as possible.  This means, however, that we can’t provide in-depth or long-term analysis services for single groups.   In these cases we encourage PIs to budget for a bioinformatics post-doc in their grant applications.   We are very happy to provide letters of support and text detailing our expertise,  and outlining possible analyses in grant applications.

###Directions
**By Public Transportation**
Take the Red Line to the Harvard Square stop, and choose the “Church Street” exit. Exit through the turnstiles and up the stairway on your left, which leads to Harvard Yard. Walk through the gate into Harvard Yard and proceed straight ahead to the statue of John Harvard. From here take the path to your left, exit the Yard, and veer slightly to the right. The Science Center (a large, concrete structure with a rock formation in front) will be on your left, and Memorial Hall (a large, ornate red brick building with a tall steeple) on your right. This path will take you to the intersection of Kirkland and Oxford Streets. Cross the street, and proceed left down Oxford Street. You will see the Harvard Museum of Natural History on your right. Take the first path on the right after the Museum and follow it to the [main entrance of the Northwest Building](http://rc.fas.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Northwest-Building.jpg).

**From the North**
Take I-93 or Route 1 south toward Boston. Take the exit for “Storrow Drive-Cambridge.” Follow Storrow Drive west for approximately 4 miles. After approximately 2 miles Storrow Drive becomes Soldiers Field road. You will not notice any change. Stay in the right hand lane in order to avoid the many left hand exits off Storrow Drive until you reach the exit marked “Harvard Square/Cambridge.” Take the exit and go over the Charles River to the set of lights at Memorial Drive. Go straight ahead through the lights. You will now be on JFK Street. After you pass the intersection of JFK and Mt. Auburn Street, you will come to another set of lights where Nini’s Corner and The Coop are on the left, and Out of Town News and the subway “T” stop will be on your right. Go straight (veering slightly to the right) through these lights, passing Out of Town News. You will then approach another fork in the road — stay to the left of the fork and then immediately get into the right hand lane. This will take you onto Massachusetts Avenue, headed north. Go approximately 0.2 tenths of a mile past the Harvard Law School to Everett Street on your right. Turn right onto Everett Street and go to the next set of lights at Oxford Street. The building directly in front of you and beyond the lights is the Northwest Building.

**From the South**
Take I-93/Route 3 (South East Expressway) north and follow the above directions for Storrow Drive West.

**From the West**
Take I-90 (Massachusetts Turnpike) east. Get off the Cambridge/Allston exit (#18) and follow signs for Cambridge bearing to the right. As you come off the Turnpike exit, a 10-story hotel is on your right. Begin to move to the left lane as you pass the hotel. There is a traffic light at the corner of the hotel. Go through this light, but be prepared to make a left, before the bridge (do not cross over the bridge). You will now be on an entrance ramp leading onto Storrow Drive with very rapid traffic. Follow Storrow Drive approximately 1/2 mile. Stay in the right lane, which will become the “Harvard Square/Cambridge” exit on your right. Follow the directions given above for coming from the north starting with “. . . Take the exit and go over the Charles River . . .”

###PARKING
