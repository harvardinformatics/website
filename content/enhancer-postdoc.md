## Postdoctoral Positions
We occasionally have open positions for postdoctoral fellows in the areas of comparative genomics, population genomics, genome assembly, and phylogenetics. Currently our grant-funded work includes research on the convergent evolution of brood parasitism in birds, as well as research on methods for detecting evolutionary processes driving the evolution of non-coding regions of the genome.

Interested candidates are encouraged to contact Tim Sackton for more information.

Successful postdoctoral fellows in our group will usually have broad expertise in statistics, computational biology, population genetics, phylogenetics, computer science, or related fields, and a demonstrated record of research achievement (via publications or preprints).

**However, enthusiasm for the research questions, a track record of accomplishment, and a desire to learn are more important than any specific skills.**
